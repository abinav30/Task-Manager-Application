# Task-Manager-Application
This application has a to-do list of sorts of any user. The user can add update delete and get his tasks from the database. The project is written tn TypeScript with a mongoDB and mongoose backend and an express based server in node js.
The User can be created, he can login, logout, logout from all sessions,and the he can update his credentials or delete his account.
The project uses jwt tokens for creating secure and timed web sessions and uses the bcrypt password hashing function to hash passwords before securely storing them in the database
The server used here is express with routers and middlewares setup for appropriate routing and authentication.
Very soon after developing a front-end for the application this can be deployed on a live server.
